- Looked at the implications of obfuscating code. 
- Research one example that we can demo which is [a spinning donut](https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html)

### 5/23/24

- Added the original donut.c into the examples directory. 
- Started on working on a variation of donut.c in the demos directory. (Not Sure if its fully functional)
- Added the makefile commands in order to compile and run files in demos and examples directory. 
- Added information into README

### 5/24/24

- Added the speed x and speed z variable to donut.c demo to control spinning speed. Doesn't work, so left it to Eric to debug. 
- Trying to fix + add to Eric's early stages of obfuscate.py
