What is code obfuscation?

First, let's take a look at the word obfuscation, which means to make something difficult to understand. Code obfuscation means to make code difficult to understand or compile. 

Why is code obfuscation important?

Hiding your code is very important because in the worst case scenario that your code is stolen by bad actors, then you wouldn't want them to know how it works. It will make it difficult for them to understand how your code works and how to compile it to use it for their own benefit. If the hackers eventually do crack the code, it will take them a long time, which may be enough time to catch them.

Essentially, it will hinder the ability of hackers who steal code to understand your code. 

HOWEVER, it is important to note that code obfuscation does not help increase the security of your code AT ALL. Keeping your data safe is your own responsibility and code obfuscation does not hide your data; it only makes your code unreadable. 

What are the different methods you can use to obfuscate code? 

One way is by renaming all of your variables, function names, and parameters to single letters instead of their intended use. This will make your code harder to understand if there are no good naming conventions. 

Examples:

In the donut example shown in donut.c, the code is shaped in a donut. If someone just took the code and saw it in the donut shape, it'd take longer to piece together because of the difference in whitespace.
