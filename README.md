## Overview

Our project is all about code obfuscation. In this project, we will: 

- Why Code Obfuscation is important 
- Show some examples of obfuscated code and what function they serve
- Create and show a program made to obfuscate *YOUR* code into numerous different ways
- Demo new and variations of obfuscated code. 

## Instructions

### Examples 

Our project would include "n" examples of obfuscated code that perform various functions. Because all of the code is written in C, you would need to compile the code first. 

```
make compile
```

One of the examples that we have is a spinning donut. Running the following command would bring up that animation in the terminal. 

```
make donut
```

### Programs

### Demos

There are "n" demos that we have created. Some of them are new, while others uses the preexisting code from the examples as a template. These demos are also written in C, so you would need to compile them first. 

```
make compile
```

One of the examples is the donut code. We modify the code from the example in order to perform another function. Running the following command would bring up that animation. 

```
make donut
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some files are executable with some being an infinite loop. Running `CTRL + C` would exit all of the executable files. Other files would write new files. 

> [!WARNING]
> You need to have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) which allows you to compile the C code. This is required for all out code to run.
