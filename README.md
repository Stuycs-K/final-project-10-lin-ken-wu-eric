## Overview

Our project is all about code obfuscation. In this project, we will explain why code obfuscation is important, demo different methods of code obfuscation, and create a program to obfuscate code. 
- Show some examples of obfuscated code and what function they serve
- Demo a program made to obfuscate code that you input in different ways

## Instructions

### Examples 

Our project would include "n" examples of obfuscated code that perform various functions. Because all of the code is written in C, you would need to compile the code first. 

```
make compile
```

One of the examples that we have is a donut that is spinning/rotated along an axis or two. Running the following command would bring up that animation in the terminal. 

```
make donut
```

> [!NOTE]
> Running `CTRL + C` would exit all of the executable files.
